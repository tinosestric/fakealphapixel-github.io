									<h2 class="major">What is it all about, and why it has value?</h2>
									<p>#fakealphapixel is the first Conceptual Art project, sourced from the topic of NFTs and their critics, exhibited virtually and physically in a renowned gallery.
<br><br>
My main goal is to make Art that questions the value of digital assets, that could go from 0 to ∞, and relation to their communities.
<br><br>
It all started with a genious idea of my friend prof. Antonio Rollo - minting a transparent <a href="http://0280.org/alphapixel">pixel </a>  - the shortest possible .gif code of alphapixel on the blockchain. As I was analysing the scene at the time, and saw how the Art and Artists got exploited in early 2021, I immediately produced a response with deploying "declared fakes of alphapixel" (with artist's statements) on 8 blockchains, that i knew at the time supported codeless minting. I started to make site specific Art interventions that resulted with an exhibition in Galerija Gallery on the end of October 21.  I also play with the semantic jokes, as a response to silly marketing and sales copys that are used in some cases.  4x4 #fakealphapixels - off road, is one example... The project is ongoing and i'm constantly adding new material to my collection, working on couple of exhibitions and web based projects, and meanwhile researching the web3 applications of my fake raw materials for windows in metaverses.  I'm not prommising any value, but it formed by itself by recent purcases on opensea for couple of ETH.
<br><br>
Here are some artworks from the series #fakealphapixel with brief descriptions:
</p>

											<h3 class="major">#fakealphapixel ON CANVASS</h3>
											<p>Artwork represents a painting with the printscreen of proof of burn the #fakealphapixel NFT on BSC network, with a transparent plastic foil pixel phisically burnt over it. The pedestal of installation is a distached wooden frame, packing paper - transport pakage in which the painting was brought to the exhibition, and a standing lighter, clearly an invite to phisically burn the Artwork. Unfortunaly noone had enough courage to do so.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">#fakealphapixel ON PAPER</h3>
											<p>This installation is a pixel square hole, a cutout from crushed semi-transparent piece of paper. With looking through it viewers could read the words: "it's a hole" that were written by hand on the pedestal. It's ment to be an impulse to think about the reciprocity of digital assets, and their fooling appearance in context of a collector.<br><br></p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">#fakealphapixel EAT</h3>
											<p>The installation was made from edible transparent cubes, that were assembled in composition of letters "Eat". Intention was to provoke the viewer to eat them, and it was succesfull. In a part of performance that I initiated, some of us tasted the fake transparent pixels from a decorative pedestal. It's setting was in horizontal position, to resemble the improvised snacks that are usually put on display on such exhibitions. </p>

											<h3 class="major">#fakealphapixel exhibition narration</h3>
											<p>When the exhibition was opened, it started with a performance of computer introducing the Artist. I was totally quiet on the formal part of the opening, so everybody could speculate that there is higher digital entity orchestrating the event. Computer also pulled a couple of jokes on me, I don't blame it tho.<br><br></p>

											<h3 class="major">#fakealphapixel proof of transparency - pot</h3>
											<p>The artwork is a collection of qr-codes, that were leading to all the of listings on marketplaces, each on different blockchains, where #fakealphapixels were deployed. On the end there was a sticker claiming, that these are a proof of transparency for the whole project. They really were. </p>

											<h3 class="major">#fakealphapixel - banksy mode </h3>
											<p>This is the outcome of performance, where i gave a comment on the actions of people, that cut the Banksy's street art out of their original walls for whatever reasons. I performed a cut out of transparent pixels of my #alleged# street art piece, a mobile device glued on the wall, and put them on display in a gallery as the remaining layers of hardware. Photo documentation of the event was also presented in a culture jamming approach on a fake Time magazine cover. </p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">#fakealphapixel 6d</h3>
											<p>This scultpure is inviting the viewer to give it a push and put the installation to it's crash - merge. Two cubes 2x3d = 6d. The top heavy plaster cube standing in ballance on it's corner, put in a manner that needs just a little push, to land on the lower fragile glass cube. Pedestal is depicting the shortest possible .gif code of a transparent pixel. I was assuming, that if there was too much visitors of the exhibition, someone had to make a mistake and cause the inballance. It'd be a catastrophy in their mind, but a nice depiction of crashing the blockchain in case of too many users.<br><br>

											<h3 class="major">#fakealphapixel original fake </h3>
											<p>I'm asking myself, what originality really means, where did the general public idea emerge from, was it just a consequece of someone's ego, and a medium of surprise? I'm curious if originality is just a statement of ownership, to justify the economic means of an individual. All art can original, even if it's a copy, or is it?</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ode to #fakealphapixel</h2>
								<p>

								It is transparent,<br>
small usually<br>
and is “fake”.<br>
Non existent.<br>
At least not in the physical world.<br><br>
It's a copy.<br>
A copy of nothing<br>
what you could see,<br>
is a copy.<br>
Transparent pixel.<br>
Hence the copy<br>
basic building block of<br>
everything visual on the internet.<br><br>
And yet it’s not just one copy,<br>
it’s a sea of copies,<br>
which have many different interpretations,<br>
copies.<br><br>
Disregards copyright,<br>
does not respect the principles of rarity,<br>
ignores everything.<br>
multiplies, transforms, applies,<br>
as it wills.<br>
But not Chinese.<br>
Copy.<br><br>
Thanks Antonio.<br><br><br>
______________<br>
My material is - fake, plagiarism,<br>
copy. In the digital environment of NFTs.<br>
#fakealphapixel is web 3.0. With it, I occupy many dimensions of the blockchains.<br>
I will occupy more.<br>
And yet, I wonder about its physicality.<br>
Its approximation,<br>
its manifestation in other dimensions.<br>
I managed to put a couple of them
in the installations that are on display.<br>
you will see the digital NOTHING,<br>
but it is much more than nothing<br>
and it is packed with countless meanings.<br>
At least that's how I think of it...
